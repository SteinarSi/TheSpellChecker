Some things that can be done:

Define a new function:
f(x, y) = 5x + y^2

Evaluate an expression just by typing it:
3+f(4, 5)

Show a function:
f

Get a function derivatives (if possible) by referring to f', f'', etc:
f(3, 4) + f'(5, 6) + f''(10, 20)
The default is differentiating with respect to its first parameter, 
but you can differentiate with respect to any parameter (for example y) by typing
