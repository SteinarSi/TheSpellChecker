Welcome to S.U.C.C: Steinar's Unique Calculus Calculator!


Some things that can be done:

    Define a new function:
        f(x, y) = 5x + y^2

    Evaluate an expression just by typing it:
        3+f(4, 5)

    Show a function:
        f

    Get a function derivatives (if possible) by referring to f', f'', etc:
    f(3, 4) + f'(5, 6) + f''(10, 20)
    The default is differentiating with respect to its first parameter, 
    but you can differentiate with respect to any parameter (for example y) by typing
        f'y(10, 20)

    Some self-explaining one-word commands:
        save
        load
        quit
        help
        clear

    To visualize functions or points, first add it with the 'add' command:
        add f
        add (5, 7)
    Then draw it in its own window with:
        draw
    There is currently no way to close the window without exiting the program :((
